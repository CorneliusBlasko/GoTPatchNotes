## CLASSES

### Targaryen

- **Daenerys**' model has received a new title: [*Queen of the Ashes*].
- **Grey Worm**'s [*Spear Arm*] skill has a 50% chance to proc automatically when an enemy unit turns their back on him. The chance increases to 100% if a friendly unit has died.

### Lannister

- Should one of the Clegane brothers die within 5 meters of the other there is a 50% chance of a mutual kill occurring.
- Jaime Lannister's Sword skill has been nerfed in order to give characters a more fair fight.
- **Euron Greyjoy** properly flagged as "nonessential".

## CREATURES

- Seeing how he is the last dragon on the map, **Drogon** has been given the buff [*Heir of Smaug*]. His breath attack now deals siege damage to buildings and has a 75% chance of insta-killing NPCs of level lower than 5.
- **Drogon**'s Stealth increased 100%, you can no longer hear him approaching if there is any building or landscape between you and the dragon.
- **Daenery**'s Dragons encounter modified: whenever one of the two dragons die the other one enrages and has its damage and speed increased by 500%

## QUESTS

- Item [**Scorpion**] removed from game.
- **Clegane Brothers** removed from game.
- New zone added: the **Ashland**.
- **Golden Company** being level 1 characters works as intended.
- **Stark** faction reputation with **King's Landing** commoners reverted to *Hated* to match Patch 1.10 values.
- Item [**The Iron Throne**] is now a Grey quality item (down from Heirloom) and it can be sold to any vendor.
- **The Red Keep** is now a non-accessible zone. King's Landing has been replaced with a skybox image of a burned ruin. If you had quests to turn in there for **Lannister**, **High Septon**, or various other city faction and merchants, you will be awarded a small amount of gold courtesy of the Iron Bank.
- Trade routes are now free of pirates, it is easier to conduct trade alliances with Essos.
- The final known undead enemy has been removed from the game, you no longer need to spec into holy damage, fire damage or train to use Valyrian steel or Dragon Glass weapons to counter the undead.

## BUG FIXES

- Reduced the NPC population of **King's Landing** to help frame-rate issues 
- Fixed a bug with the **Dothraki** race that prevented their models from displaying entirely. The **Dothraki** should now be visible
- Due to logic error in script, **Daenerys** is aggroed upon end of battle.
- **Jon Snow**'s Leadership stat had the unintended effect of buffing his units beyond comparable heroes. It has been nerfed to put him in line with other Commander units.
- Seeing as how [**Valyrian steel**] is no longer relevant for the current scenarios, weapons made with it had their stats brought more in line with other weapons of the same type.
- Dragon-killer bolts no longer break the laws of physics.
